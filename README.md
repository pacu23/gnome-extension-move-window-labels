# gnome-extension-move-window-labels

Copied the code from Native Window Placement extension that moves the window labels while in Overview, to be able to achieve that without that extension. When using other extensions, the labels sometimes get obstructed, that's why one might desire this. Extract to ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/.
